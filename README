The original idea was born out of need because of brute force login attempts on
a Joomla site I administrate. It was inspired by, and small parts were reused
from the following plugins:
  - Login Failed Log
  - Redirect Failed Logins
  - Ban IP Address/Range
Thanks very much for the authors of these plugins!
