Brute Force Stop (bfstop)
Joomla System Plugin
by Bernhard Froehler

This plugin is intended to hinder brute force login attempts to any Joomla! site.

To get the latest version, go to "Files" section on github
(https://github.com/codeling/bfstop) - if you're not already there -
then in the branch/tags dropdown go to the "Tags" tab and select the highest
version. Then press the "ZIP" button. This will download the plugin as zip file,
which you can directly import into your Joomla! installation.

The original idea was born out of need because of brute force login attempts on
a Joomla site I administrate. It was inspired by, and small parts were reused
from the following plugins:
  - Login Failed Log
  - Redirect Failed Logins
  - Ban IP Address/Range
Thanks very much for the authors of these plugins!
