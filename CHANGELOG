0.9.7 (2013-01-07)
  - corrects the plugin name (meaning you have to uninstall previous versions
    manually! if this is the first version you installed, there's nothing
    special to do)
  - corrects problems with not loaded language files during install,
    causing a text like PLG_BFSTOP_DESC instead of a meaningful description

0.9.6 (2013-01-06)
  - removes password from failed login entries in the database to prevent
    information disclosure
	

0.9.5 (2012-12-06)
