0.9.10.2 (2013-05-28)
  - fix for issue #12 "bfstop doesn't block", where a block duration of
    unlimited would always lead to no IP being blocked

0.9.10.1 (2013-05-17)
  - fix unblock by token link for administration login
  - fix Joomla! 3 compatibility
  - fix DB query problem introduced with refactoring

0.9.10 (2013-05-13)
  - adds pt-PT and pt-BR translations (thanks to solrac!)
  - fixes a problem that no IP addresses were blocked when the MySQL timezone
    and the PHP timezone were not the same
  - adds a table to display and allow unblocking of the currently blocked IP
    addresses to the backend
  - adds the possibility to send an email to a user, in case login was tried
    for an existing user, to allow him to unblock his IP.
  - a successful login now resets the failed login count
  - disables "remaining attempts" hint when blocking is disabled
  - adapts default block interval to 1 day

0.9.9 (2013-04-05)
  - adds a configurable "automatic unblock time", i.e. a time after which an IP
    address will be automatically allowed to do further login attempts.
    this replaces the previous "block interval"
    Note (added 2013-04-20): The default value for the block duration was set
    to 30 minutes with the introduction of this version; meaning that the
    default behavior of the plugin changed from blocking an IP address forever
    to blocking it only 30 minutes, and also to considering only the failed
    login attempts from those last 30 minutes; meaning the number of attempts
    allowed for attackers was drastically increased. The default values will
    be adjusted with the next version to allow less attempts.
  - implements optional notification about the number of remaining login
    attempts before the IP address will be blocked

0.9.8 (2013-01-23)
  - corrects small problems with logging which prevented previous versions
    to be installable on Joomla! 3.0. This should now be possible. In case you
    look at the log and wonder about some deprecation warnings - it seems that
    some functions were deprecated without providing replacement yet...

0.9.7 (2013-01-15)
  - corrects the plugin name (meaning you have to uninstall previous versions
    manually! if this is the first version you installed - which is very likely,
    since no version before has been published to JED -  there's nothing
    special to do)
  - corrects problems with not loaded language files during install,
    causing a text like PLG_BFSTOP_DESC instead of a meaningful description
  - adds an option to en- or disable logging (some internal messages about what
    the plugin is doing, written to a file), disables it by default

0.9.6 (2013-01-06)
  - removes password from failed login entries in the database to prevent
    information disclosure

0.9.5 (2012-12-06)
  - Version initially released to the public
  - fixes uninstall script previusly causing an error
