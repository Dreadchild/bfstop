0.9.7 (2013-01-15)
  - corrects the plugin name (meaning you have to uninstall previous versions
    manually! if this is the first version you installed - which is very likely,
    since no version before has been published to JED -  there's nothing
    special to do)
  - corrects problems with not loaded language files during install,
    causing a text like PLG_BFSTOP_DESC instead of a meaningful description
  - adds an option to en- or disable logging, disables it by default

0.9.6 (2013-01-06)
  - removes password from failed login entries in the database to prevent
    information disclosure

0.9.5 (2012-12-06)
  - Version initially released to the public
  - fixes uninstall script previusly causing an error
