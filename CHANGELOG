0.9.9 (2013-04-05)
  - adds a configurable "automatic unblock time", i.e. a time after which an IP
    address will be automatically allowed to do further login attempts.
    this replaces the previous "block interval"
  - implements optional notification about the number of remaining login
    attempts before the IP address will be blocked

0.9.8 (2013-01-23)
  - corrects small problems with logging which prevented previous versions
    to be installable on Joomla! 3.0. This should now be possible. In case you
    look at the log and wonder about some deprecation warnings - it seems that
    some functions were deprecated without providing replacement yet...

0.9.7 (2013-01-15)
  - corrects the plugin name (meaning you have to uninstall previous versions
    manually! if this is the first version you installed - which is very likely,
    since no version before has been published to JED -  there's nothing
    special to do)
  - corrects problems with not loaded language files during install,
    causing a text like PLG_BFSTOP_DESC instead of a meaningful description
  - adds an option to en- or disable logging (some internal messages about what
    the plugin is doing, written to a file), disables it by default

0.9.6 (2013-01-06)
  - removes password from failed login entries in the database to prevent
    information disclosure

0.9.5 (2012-12-06)
  - Version initially released to the public
  - fixes uninstall script previusly causing an error
